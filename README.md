# Project Euler Solutions

These are my solutions to some the [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net)
problems. I make no claim about them being correct or efficient. In fact,
they're probably really inefficient, since I'm using Project Euler as a platform
for playing around with languages I'd like to learn or don't know much about.

**Spoiler Alert!** Do not look at this code if you're interested in solving the
problems yourself!
